# K-Means Clustering Visualizer

This is a simple visualization of the K-Means clustering algorithm using Python and `matplotlib`.  
Synthetic data is generated with two clusters, and the algorithm dynamically shows how the centroids shift during each iteration.

## Features
- Animated visualization of centroid updates
- Step-by-step clustering
- Randomly generated data
- Easily adjustable parameters
